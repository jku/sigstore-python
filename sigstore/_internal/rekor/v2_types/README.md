# V2 Types

TODO: Eventually move these types to sigstore/protobuf-specs.

These are types meant to be used with RekorV2.

Generated from running `make python` in sigstore/rekor-tiles to generate (although not checked into git) and copied into here, **plus** formatting and lint fixes.

Eventually, we will move these types into sigstore/protobuf-specs.
